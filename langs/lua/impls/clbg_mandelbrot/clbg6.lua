-- The Computer Language Benchmarks Game
-- https://salsa.debian.org/benchmarksgame-team/benchmarksgame/
-- contributed by Mike Pall
-- modified by Rob Kendrick to be parallel
-- modified by Isaac Gouy
-- modified by ImagicTheCat (fix popen args)

-- called with the following arguments on the command line;
-- 1: size of mandelbrot to generate
-- 2: number of children to spawn (defaults to 6, which works well on 4-way)
-- If this is a child, then there will be additional parameters;
-- 3: start row
-- 4: end row
--
-- Children buffer up their output and emit it to stdout when
-- finished, to avoid stalling due to a full pipe.
