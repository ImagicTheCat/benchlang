This project aims to be a tool, a collection of measures and a website about benchmarking languages and their implementations. Measures are nice; interpretation of those measures is up to human beings.

== Concepts

Measures are generated in the `results/` directory for a specific host, a specific language, a specific environment, a specific work and a specific implementation of this work.

=== Language

A programming language.

=== Environment

A specific language builder/VM/etc executing an implementation's source code.

=== Work

Something that must be done by the languages; Different set of parameters and expected outputs are used to verify that the work has been done correctly.

=== Implementation

An implementation of a specific work in a specific language.

=== Host

Describes all the information about the machine/OS where the work is executed and common parameters used to generate the results for all languages.
