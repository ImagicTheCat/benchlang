# Fibonacci (naive recursion)

`version 1`

```
The goal is to measure performance of a recursive function pattern like Fibonacci.
It should be implemented as close as possible to the following mathematical function.

A000045 OEIS
Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

args: n
output: f(n) number as text
  
```

## Steps

* `(7)`
* `(25)`
* `(40)`
