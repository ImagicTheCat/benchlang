Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MathWorld: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiDigits.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some language implementations have arbitrary precision arithmetic built-in; some provide an arbitrary precision arithmetic library; some use a third-party library (GMP); some provide built-in arbitrary precision arithmetic by wrapping a third-party library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The work is to use aribitrary precision arithmetic and the same step-by-step algorithm to generate digits of Pi. Do both extract(3) and extract(4). Don't optimize away the work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to implement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also use the same algorithm to calculate that result.

Each program should:
- calculate the first N digits of Pi
- print the digits 10-to-a-line, with the running total of digits calculated

[...]

Adapt the step-by-step algorithm given on pages 4,6 & 7 of [pdf 156KB] Unbounded Spigot Algorithms for the Digits of Pi (http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf). (Not the deliberately obscure version given on page 2. Not the Rabinowitz-Wagon algorithm.)
