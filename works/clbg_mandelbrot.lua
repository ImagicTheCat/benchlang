How to implement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also use the same algorithm to calculate that result.

Each program should:

plot the Mandelbrot set [-1.5-i,0.5+i] on an N-by-N bitmap. Write output byte-by-byte in portable bitmap format.
